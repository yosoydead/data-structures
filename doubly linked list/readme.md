4. 4) [ ] add an item at a certain position
5. 5) [ ] delete at a certain position
6. 6) [ ] delete from the left
7. 7) [ ] delete from the right
8. 8) [x] iterate from the left
9. 9) [x] iterate from the right
10. 10) [x] size function (i added it)
11. 11) [x] is empty function (i added it)
12. 12) [x] see the first item in the list (i added it)
13. 13) [x] see the last item in the list (i added it)
