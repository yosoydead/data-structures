Operations on a doubly linked list:
1. 1) [x] create a list
2. 2) [x] add items at the beginning of the list
3. 3) [x] add items at the end of the list
4. 4) [x] add an item at a certain position
5. 5) [ ] delete at a certain position
6. 6) [x] delete from the left (i undestand that it is the first element that i need to delete)
7. 7) [x] delete from the right (i understand that it is the last element that i need to delete)
8. 8) [x] iterate from the left
9. 9) [x] iterate from the right
10. 10) [x] size function (i added it)
11. 11) [x] is empty function (i added it)
12. 12) [x] see the first item in the list (i added it)
13. 13) [x] see the last item in the list (i added it)
14. 14) [x] get method that returns the node from a given index
15. 15) [x] set method that updates the value of a certain node
