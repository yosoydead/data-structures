The creation of a circular linked list is similar to the one of the singly linked list, the difference being that the next pointer of the last element in the list will not have the value of None/null, but it will have the value of the first element in the list.

1. [x] Create a singly linked list.  
2. [x] Modify it so that it will be a circular linked list.  
3. [x] Create the methods for the list.
