* How it works:
    - every parent node has at most two children
    - every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent
    - every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent
* It is called binary search tree (BST) because it is an **ordered/sorted** binary tree.
* Every tree has the following elements:
    - root -> **the top node in a tree**
    - child -> **a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root**
    - siblings -> **a group of nodes with the same parent**
    - descendant -> **a node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child**
    - leaf -> **a node with no children**
    - branch node -> **a node with at least one child**
