1. [x] 1.1) Write a program that creates a singly linked list in which every node, besides the next pointer, contains a variable of type struct/class which will contain some data about a student. The function will return the address of the first node in the list. Read input for:
    - name: 20 chars
    - surname: 20 chars
    - a vector that will contain 3 grades of the student  
    I did not bother with input validation. I just wanted to see the program working. Also, the grades are not from input, but are randomly generated.  
2. [x] 1.2) Write a program that will display the name, surname and the average grade of each student from the list of the previous exercise. The function will receive as a parameter the first element in the list.
3. [x] 1.3) Write a function that returns the average grade of all students in the linked list
4. [x] 2) Write a program that creates and outputs a singly linked list. Each node contains a next pointer and a number <= 100000. The numbers are found, all on one line, in a text file.
5. [x] 3) Write a program that creates and prints two singly linked lists. The first one will contain, in the reading order, the even numbers and the second will contain odd numbers, in the same order. The numbers are read from a text file. All of them are on a single line, separated by a single space. Ex: 0 2 5 9 8 3 6 7 1, one list will be: 0 2 8 6, the second: 5 9 3 7 1
6. [x] 3.1) Write a subprogram that creates a text file with the data from the two linked lists from before. The first line will contain the data from the first list, the second line the data from the second list.
