1. [x] 1.1) Write a program that creates a singly linked list in which every node, besides the next pointer, contains a variable of type struct/class which will contain some data about a student. The function will return the address of the first node in the list. Read input for:
    - name: 20 chars
    - surname: 20 chars
    - a vector that will contain 3 grades of the student  
    I did not bother with input validation. I just wanted to see the program working. Also, the grades are not from input, but are randomly generated.  
2. [ ] 1.2) Write a program that will display the name, surname and the average grade of each student from the list of the previous exercise. The function will receive as a parameter the first element in the list.
3. [ ] 1.3) Write a function that returns the average grade of all students in the linked list
